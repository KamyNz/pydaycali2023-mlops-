> **Note: The repository is structured into various sections for the installation and configuration of MLflow. You should read other relevant prerequisites before you begin!**

## Relevant Prerequisites
- [Follow these instructions to generate environment](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cKt_1HJ4R_A4a8m9L3SW7RYCPYqYkyrUGv_dk4XTB8c/edit?usp=sharing)
- A python=3.10 environment
- [Run cells of Jupyter Notebook in repo](./use_case/notebook/MLflow_Local.ipynb)
- [PowerPoint-Presentation-in-Spanish](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1B4s1wYS_IuFgmeCPmgrnu1IGfCIbPvm7DJwaLaY-S_k/edit?usp=sharing)

## Key Audience
- Data science teams looking to take their first steps in enhancing ML processes
- Individuals with a Data Scientist role that are interested in MLOPs
- Individuals with a Data Engineer role that are interested in MLOPs
- Individuals with an ML Engineer role that are interested in MLOPs
- Any other role seeking practical experience for tracking parameters and artifacts related to managing machine learning models.

## Goals
- Introduction to MLOps
- Introduction to MLflow
- Interaction with MLflow from localhost

## Demo Scenario
> **Note: Read the following before you begin!**

An analytics team wants to start implementing an MLOps culture. Therefore, along with their technical leader, they are going to set up a tracking server using [MLflow](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/getting-started/index.html) on localhost because they are checking out MLflow as their MLOPs tool.

Similarly, the technical leader of the analytics team aims to streamline the compilation of the library of experiments that team members have been generating in Python scripts or Jupyter notebooks on their personal computers.
