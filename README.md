- [Follow these instructions to generate environment](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cKt_1HJ4R_A4a8m9L3SW7RYCPYqYkyrUGv_dk4XTB8c/edit?usp=sharing)
- A python=3.10 environment
- [Run cells of Jupyter Notebook in repo](./use_case/notebook/MLflow_Local.ipynb)

## Key Audience
- Data science teams looking to take their first steps on enhance ML processes
- Individuals with a Data Scientist role
- Individuals with a Data Engineer role
- Individuals with an ML Engineer role
- Any other role seeking practical experience for tracking parameters and artifacts related to managing machine learning models.

## Goals
- Introduction to MLOps
- Introduction to MLflow
- Interaction with MLflow from localhost

## Demo Scenario
> **Note: Read the following before you begin!**

An analytics team wants to start implementing an MLOps culture. Therefore, along with their technical leader, they are going to set up a tracking server using [MLflow](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/what-is-mlflow.html) on localhost because there are checking out MLflow as ther MLOPs tool.

Similarly, the technical leader of the analytics team aims to streamline the compilation of the library of experiments that team members have been generating in python scripts or Jupyter notebooks on their personal computers.
